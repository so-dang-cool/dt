# Helping out

If you like dt and want to see it succeed, we could use your help.

## Discussion

Write about dt! Talk about how you use it, how it works well, and how it can
be improved. Have opinions, listen to others, and have healthy debates.

When writing about dt, it's recommended to use the tag "dt-lang" (however that
makes sense to you) to help your content show up in searches.

Some ideas are getting-started guides, best practice suggestions, times to NOT
use dt, and benchmarks that compare it against similar tools.

This is useful for other users, and also useful for helping surface areas for
improvement in the project.

## Documentation

dt's documentation can always be improved.

Your feedback is valuable! Create documentation-related issues
[on github](https://github.com/booniepepper/dt/issues) when explanations or
guidance can be improved.

If you like technical writing, also consider contributing to
[the website and user-guide sources](https://github.com/booniepepper/dt/tree/gh-pages).

## Packaging

Packaging for Linux distributions, BSD ports trees, and other package managers
like Homebrew is waiting on:

1. The release of Zig 0.11.+, and
2. Adoption of Zig 0.11.+ in distros and package managers

If these conditions are met (or if your package manager can support it early)
then package away and let us know so we can keep track and avoid breaking
changes.

In the future, the project does not plan to adopt pre-release versions of
Zig, primarily to support package managers. (We love you, thanks for vending
software to us! It's not easy.) Also the plan is to keep dependencies to a
minimum and allow the project to be available in early bootstrapping phases
and easy to independently upgrade.

## Developing

If you have skills in dt and/or Zig, you might consider contributing to
[the project](https://github.com/booniepepper/dt) directly.

The utility and the language are intentionally kept minimal. If you're
interested in adding features to the language, please
[open an issue](https://github.com/booniepepper/dt/issues) before digging in.

[start with no](https://basecamp.com/gettingreal/05.3-start-with-no) until I'm
convinced that something is crucial to the goals of the project. Much of the
value of dt, and its longevity, will be defined by the features it avoids.
